## Executive Summary

This project presents a robust, modular data acquisition and transmission system combining the strengths of an STM32 Nucleo-F446RE microcontroller, an ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer, and a Raspberry Pi 4B+. The solution integrates low-level I2C and UART drivers, real-time telemetry streaming over MQTT, and live data visualization through ThingsBoard and Processing IDE.

It’s designed for learning, experimentation, and extension—building foundational experience in embedded data pipelines, custom driver integration, and scalable IoT architecture.

## System Overview

### STM32 Nucleo-F446RE  
- Interfaces with ADXL345 via I2C (Fast Mode)  
- Acquires real-time accelerometer data (X, Y, Z axes)  
- Communicates over UART with Raspberry Pi for data offloading  
- Implements custom HAL-compatible driver in C  
- Handles peripheral initialization and basic processing on bare-metal  

### Raspberry Pi 4B+  
- Hosts a Python MQTT client for telemetry publication  
- Captures UART packets from STM32 and forwards to ThingsBoard Cloud  
- Collects system metrics (CPU, RAM, disk) for diagnostics  
- Supports optional 3D visualization via Processing IDE
